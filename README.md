# 🏇 Horse Racing - Horse Race Winner Prediction System

**Horse Racing** is a machine learning system that predicts whether a horse will win a race, developed as a computer science project. Using data from `race-result-horse.csv`, it trains a random forest model to analyze horse, jockey, and race features. A Flask backend delivers predictions, while a Next.js frontend provides an intuitive interface for inputting race data and viewing results. Ideal for racing fans and data scientists! 🌟

## ✨ Features
- 🐎 **Winner Prediction**: Classifies horses as winners or non-winners based on race data.
- 📊 **Accurate Model**: Achieves ~80% accuracy (tune `backend/train_model.py` for better results).
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Next.js frontend for inputting race features (e.g., horse speed, jockey experience).
- 📈 **Confidence Scores**: Displays prediction probabilities (e.g., “Winner: 85%”).
- 💾 **Model Persistence**: Saves trained model (`backend/horse_race_predictor_model.pkl`) for fast predictions.
- 🛠️ **Extensible**: Supports adding new features or models to enhance performance.
